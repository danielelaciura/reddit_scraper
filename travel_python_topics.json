    "body": "\n      The current obsession with traveling is one of the most unattractive\u2014and frankly, red flag-worthy\u2014traits in dating, especially in women.\n    \n\n      When \u2018loves to travel\u2019 dominates someone\u2019s personality, it often signals escapism and a lack of long-term stability.\n    \n\n      Sure, vacations and cultural exploration can be enriching, but when travel becomes their defining feature, it raises questions about their ability to commit\u2014to a person, a place, or even a purpose.\n    \n\n      It can also reflect a desire for the glamorous, Instagrammable lifestyle rather than genuine depth or ambition.\n    \n\n      Plus, let\u2019s be honest: constant travel is expensive, and if they\u2019re not footing the bill, someone else likely is.\n    \n\n      The fixation on travel isn\u2019t just superficial\u2014it might also indicate a tendency to avoid the realities of life in favor of chasing fleeting highs.\n    \n\n      A relationship requires grounding, and someone always in search of their next destination might never truly be present where it matters.\n    \n\n      Thank you for coming to my ted talk\n    "

    "body": "\n      I'm in my late 20s and the older I'm getting, the less inclined I am to travel anywhere. I prefer day trips so I can come back home and sleep in my bed. I don't like packing, getting up early to get the train/flight, arranging travel insurance, organising a dogsitter... and the list goes on.\n    \n\n      With today's technology we can walk the streets of a city on the other side of the planet. We can live chat and communicating with people from another country and in that way broaden our horizons. I have travelled. I have seen important cultural landmarks... and I always feel underwhelmed. I realise that the fact that I have travelled means that I have been privileged as not everyone can afford it, and I don't blame people for wanting to travel and experience it. I simply don't get they hype and pressure that exists to do it.\n    \n\n      I am a bit over people that turn travelling into their entire personality, especially if they only travel 1-2 times a year. To me, it feels like so much wasted money on a week when you could have invested that money into savings or something more tangible I suppose.\n    \n\n      I enjoy waking up in the morning, going for a walk with my dog, listen to the birds tweet, cook lunch, watch a movie in the evening, organising my closet. The everyday kind of things. It would be nice to know there are other people my age feeling the same way, because sometimes I feel a bit of an outcast haha.\n    "

    "body": "\n      There seems to be a fetish around travel with people these days, like it is the greatest thing in the world. When, in reality, it mostly sucks.\n    \n\n      Travel is just something suburban white kids / pathetic \"influencers\" do to flex.  And a way for otherwise boring individuals to feel they are special.\n    \n\n      People act like travelling somewhere for two weeks makes them appreciative of other cultures and different people.  That is straight up laughable.  Eating a burrito in Mexico does NOT make you Hispanic anymore than drinking some wine in France wine makes you culturally French.  Shitting in the alps doesn't make you Swiss.  Getting head inside Big Ben as the clock strikes 12 doesn't make you British.\n    \n\n      What travel is really like:\n    \n\n      Pack up all your stuff, but probably forget things you need.\n    \n\n      Go to a transportation hub like an airport where you are elbow to elbow with other people rushing around to get invasively probed by the TSA. Board a plane where you are crammed in a really small space with the humanity's worst people. Have to listen to some Z blast music from his cell phone or some silly parenting podcast all flight.\n    \n\n      Get to the destination and figure out where your lodging is. Then try to figure out where to get food 3 times a day.\n    \n\n      Pay lots of money to stand in lines for long periods of time.  When you do get to see something cool, you have like 10 seconds to see it before you have to move along because the line behind you is so long.\n    \n\n      Explore places jammed with other people, mostly acting dumb and doing selfies and livestreaming.\n    \n\n      Don't even get me started on how awful travel is for the environment and global warming.\n    \n\n      Travel is way overrated.\n    "

I plan to go with the flow without really planning; only the intention of getting to each country at some point. If I feel connected to people or a place, I\u2019ll stay. I just want to live in the moment. Slow and spontaneous travel. I\u2019m also open to recommendations along the way that may take me to new places I hadn\u2019t known of before.\n    \n\n      How realistic is this? Can anyone provide their personal experience with this style of unplanned long-term travel?\n    \n\n      UPDATE: Wow, thank you all so much for your advice and insights!! You all are so inspiring. After reading through the comments, I\u2019m deciding to cancel out Bhutan, Pakistan, Samoa and Vanuatu. I\u2019ll have a homie hosting me in NZ so transport, stay, and food will be mostly covered there. Love the idea of volunteering and work exchanges in the other places for slow and meaningful travel :)\n    "
