The idea is to create a digital list for a specific country that includes:\n    \n\n      Popular tourist spots in one place\n    \n\n      Short description of each location\n    \n\n      Suggested activities\n    \n\n      Direct Google Maps links + opening hours + entrance fee / ticket price\n    \n\n      I often find myself juggling multiple blogs, vlogs, and posts just to put reliable info together and the vlogger\u2019s recommendations / long video can be limiting or time-consuming. Even using AI tools to plan trip often only introduces a few famous places, and the information isn\u2019t always up to date. So I would be happy to pay someone who collects everything in one easy-to-scan place to help with trip planning.\n    \n\n      But I\u2019m curious what others think about this idea, and would love your honest thoughts:\n    \n\n      Would a resource like this actually save you time/stress when planning?\n    \n\n      If you had to put a small value on something like this (say $5), would it feel worth it?\n    \n\n      If not, what\u2019s your biggest hassle or frustration when researching or planning trips?\n    \n\n      Thank you in advance for reading and sharing your opinions! \ud83d\ude4f\n    "

I try not to take any sort of pain medication because ive taken so many over-the-counter meds that i feel like it can't be good for me to take more. i have also taken prescribed steroids (methy|prednisolone) and i found that they helped. any tips or tricks would help, im desperate at this point. here is a summary of my radiology report: \u2022 L5 transitional vertebra with left-sided sacralization (Bertolotti's Syndrome), likely contributing to chronic low back pain. \u2022 Chronic instability noted at L5 on the left. \u2022 Moderate disc narrowing at L5-S1; other discs are normal.

The first time, it made a surprise visit to my right foot and leg - it happened at night so I went to sleep and it was gone the next day. Since then , I've felt it in my right hand and arm and it would just be for a few hours it felt like. Three days ago, the pain was in the left side of my face and my right arm hurt just a bit. The next day, my face felt back to normal but both of my arms have been hurting since. My left is still significantly more painful but the fact it's spreading and moving is pretty devastating. I used to think \"at least it's not my dominate hand.\" But right now it hurts more than my left \ud83d\ude2a\n    \n\n      I've never been prescribed anything for the pain. Has anyone had it travel then go back to the spot? Or is this just the start of my life getting drastically shittier? Any advice on how to slow it down maybe?\n    \n\n      Sorry, new to Reddit and just fucking rattled right now. Last month when I was mentioning my hand to my dad he said, \"maybe it's time to quit video games\" like that was the cause or the pain is from that. Whether I do something or sit there, I'm still in the same amount of pain. Shit, actually getting into a game and being focused on something else at least usually alleviates the pain.\n    \n\n      And every time I try to google crps I'm left feeling more depressed than when I pressed enter. Sorry for being a whiner, just have a lot of pent up feelings about this. Even though the diagnosis was years ago it's a lot to swallow for me.\n    \n\n      Edit: I remember I was prescribed Naproxen at one point, but  that did jack for me personally.\n    "

I've flown delta, American, United, spirit, frontier, Lufthansa, Alaska, Swiss, Air France, and British airways multiple times. I've primarily booked via Expedia or directly through the airline's website, all times of the year and in and out of multiple airports. Up until 2021 we rarely had any issues, and when there were issues they were resolved quickly and painlessly. August 2021 was the beginning of many miserable flights for both of us. Every time I've flown I've dealt with multiple delays and cancellations (only once due to weather), lost bags, disappearing reservations, and losing paid upgrades at the gate with no refunds. My most recent experience was the worst of all, to the point where I honestly don't want to fly again and it got me thinking has it always been this bad or did Covid ruin air travel? Was I just lucky for the first few years or am I unlucky now? Did I get put on some sort of secret most hated customer list? Has someone cursed me? Lol\n    \n\n      Additionally, whats your most and least trusted airline? Favorite and lease favorite airports? So far I've had the least problems with delta and the most with American. Favorite airports are DIA and MUC, least favorite by far is DFW lol\n    "

    "body": "\n      Hi folks,\n    \n\n      So at this point my K has been active for nearly two years. Along with an absurdly stubborn and immensely frustrating emotional block in my sternum that refuses to open up, I have had another recent development.\n    \n\n      Up until six weeks ago or so, I was a bodybuilder and have been for ten years. There has always been a (sometimes small, sometimes very big) degree of conflict in me over my bodybuilding. I have a terror over being small, though I can\u2019t identify why. I knew that at some point I would probably have to give up my lifting, and especially once the K woke up, that sense only grew stronger.I've always had aches and pains from lifting, but nothing crazy. Then, in the past two years, I've developed injury after inexplicable injury - deep seated muscular aches that come out of nowhere and that no masseuse or acupuncturist has been able to move. My doc sent me to PT about a year ago. I went, and something happened; it was like with the onset of PT, my body as a whole became more and more sensitive, and this led to an intense pain not only in the injured areas, but in random parts of my body throughout the day. In turn, I said, \"f**k this, PT is not helping, I'm going to try the one thing I haven't really tried yet and just stop lifting altogether.\" This led to an even bigger surge of pain all day long for weeks. Finally, I gave in and said, hell, if I'm gonna be in pain anyway then I might as well just lift. So I did. The full body intense traveling pain left, though the problem areas remained.\n    \n\n      Fast forward a year, to this January. Literally the same exact process unfolded - I said I wanna make some changes, went to PT, pain intensified in the whole body, I stopped lifting altogether six weeks ago, and since then, it feels the nerves and tissue of my body are being stabbed, twisted and burned all day long. I've gone to multiple docs, and blood work done (during which the phlebotomist DID really hit a nerve, so now I also have a tingling/painful left arm constantly), had massage and acupuncture. No one has come up with any solution other than, \"your blood and muscle tissue all looks healthy and normal: I just don't get it.\" I am 28 and feel like I am 85 and have MS.\n    \n\n      Furthermore, it feels that throughout this process, since stopping lifting, the Kundalini has found a new \"home\" right above/behind my genitals, and it feels incredibly intense and brutal. Not sure if there is just a whole bunch of stuff in that area needing to be cleared out, or what. But what I know is that the psychological demands of kundalini were already immensely difficult to bare, and now, to add to it, it feels like my body is experiencing something like systemic failure.\n    \n\n      Real sorry for long post. Does anyone have experience with anything like this? Did you make it through okay? What was helpful? Thanks a lot, guys.\n    "

I didn't want to admit it because I was embarrassed I made such a rookie mistake. My husband was being a dick on top of the fact that he just announced we were going skiing.

I would agree I'm being a jerk except the last two or three trips we have taken were stupid expensive, and for me, I got zero joy out of them. I would have preferred a night in Napa for a fraction of the cost. When I say expensive, I mean it. When I learned the price I was pissed. A week later he spent more money skiing on his own. He claims he wasn't wasting money because he had the lift ticket or whatever. Dude, your'e spending money on yourself and I'm not getting the same gift because I'm not ....skiing?

It started after a long flight a few years ago and was acute but now just flares up on long flights.\n    \n\n      The third and final time is of the usual neck pillow. I have tried all the animals!

During this trip we will be doing a fair amount of walking, which makes the pain so much worse. I have a hard time walking around a grocery store without a cart so I'm very worried how the walking is going to effect me. Does anyone have any helpful tips to maintain a low pain level during this? I know this is probably wishful thinking but I figured if any group knew anything it would be you guys.\n    \n\n      If I've left out any necessary information, lmk and I'll edit it. TIA\n    "

I had two surgeries to fix the pain, but sadly it only made it worse. Most of the pain is in my QL and shoulders/neck area.\n    \n\n      I'm responsible when it comes to taking medicines in safe doses (acetaminophen) and doing yoga, stretches and the limited exercises that I can handle. None of these things really help much, but I feel it's better than nothing.\n    \n\n      Thanks and best of luck to you all.\n    "

Some of these points may seem obvious to some but I think a list like this could be useful. I do not have arthritis myself so again, please correct and inform me if you want!\n    \n\n      Derived From: https://www.arthritis.org/health-wellness/healthy-living/daily-living/life-hacks-tips/8-tips-for-pain-free-travel\n    \n\n      1. Plan Ahead for Your Next Trip.\n    \n\n      Doing research on the geography and disability aids of your destination and airline services can reduce the pain and anxiety you could potentially experience.\n    \n\n      2. Consult Experts on Car Travel\n    \n\n      Before taking off, ask an occupational therapist or a driver rehabilitation specialist about ways you can treat yourself well on the road. Resources such as the Society for Accessible Travel and Hospitality can help with finding programs that offer cars with enhanced accessibility, such as Avis Rent-A-Car's Access program.\n    \n\n      3. Book Your Airline Seat Accordingly\n    \n\n      Try to avoid congestion and long lines by booking your flight mid week, which tends to be less busy. Also book a seat with extra legroom or an aisle seat so it's easier to stretch your legs. When finding a hotel, search for ADA accessible rooms near an elevator or on the first floor, and ask about amenities such as exercise facilities and saunas to help with physical therapy and relaxation.\n    \n\n      4. Bring an Assistive Device\n    \n\n      This could include something as simple as a pillow to use on your flight, a folding cane, or a travel chair.\n    \n\n      5. Double-Check Your Meds\n    \n\n      Make sure you have all the medications you need for your trip, taking care to set reminders for taking them and taking meds with you in a carry-on rather than in a checked bag. Also ensure that refrigerated meds are kept in coolers or small ziploc bags with icepacks.\n    \n\n      6. Control the Temperature\n    \n\n      Speaking of icepacks, bringing some extras to treat pain and stiffness along with heating pads/wraps and topical cream can help reduce pain.\n    \n\n      7. Get VIP Treatment\n    \n\n      Don't feel afraid to ask your airport for pre-boarding privileges to accommodate your arthritis. Call TSA Cares for information to help you avoid standing still for extended periods, and ask for help in stowing carry-on bags in overhead compartments from flight staff or fellow passengers.\n    \n\n      8. Choose Meals Carefully\n    \n\n      Make sure to avoid high-fat, high-calorie processed foods that promote inflammation. Unfortunately, this is very common to find in an airport, so pack healthy foods and drink plenty of water while avoiding alcohol and caffeine, which may also promote inflammation.\n    \n\n      9. Keep Moving\n    \n\n      Reduce stiffness by planning road trips with time for rest stops and moving around on a plane or train when it's safe. If you're unable to stand up, you can also try simple stretches while seated as well as isometrics in which your flex and hold muscles for about 5 seconds.\n    "

    "scraped_at": "2025-11-20 23:42:55",
    "body": "\n      Air travel used to be a luxurious experience, and even if you went economy or \"Cattle class\" it would either be fine or something you could cope with if you were a larger person or parent for example.  Now however it has become a nightmare for many traveler's. Airlines are constantly finding new ways to save money, but it's the passengers who are paying the price. Here are a few reasons why air travel has become such a horrible experience in recent times:\n    \n\n      Shrinking Seat Sizes:Airlines have been cramming more seats into their planes to maximize profits for years, but as a result of recent world economy issues, COVID and more this has resulted in yet another drive for smaller seats that are now also more lightweight and streamlined of features and thus incredibly uncomfortable for passengers. Many airlines have reduced the seat pitch (the distance from one seat to the same point on the seat in front of it) to as little as 28 inches, which is barely enough space for a small adult to sit comfortably.Then when you take into account someone in front of you reclining their seat it is a whole world of hurt. There are heaps of discussions with who is in the wrong in these cases but it is the airlines, not the passengers who are at fault.My biggest issue with all this is I have seen heaps of cost saving but better solutions to seating layouts and seat designs that would make peoples lives better but still tick the airline boxes.. They just do not want to take the leaps in more modern approaches.I always say to people how I remember the same types of planes which were 2 by 3 by 2 which are now 3 by 4 by 3 and even if you are not that big your elbows and shoulders are in the isles getting hit by people or infringing on other peoples seats.\n    \n\n      Last-Minute Plane Changes:Airlines are changing planes at the last minute to smaller planes if seats are not full in the effort to save further costs on fuel and help with the staffing issues they are facing to again save money and costs. This means that traveler's who were expecting a certain type of plane with certain amenities might end up on a smaller plane that's missing all the comforts they were looking forward to. In many cases you may be on a 6-10 hour international flight but on a domestic plane. Here the Media selections are less, where there should be 2 sets of toilets there are now only one and again everything is smaller.\n    \n\n      Other changes like food:There are a number of factors for recent changes but they all result into poorer services and quality of the flight and food.Many countries are now scrapping single use plastic's so like with Australian Airlines your food is being served to you in a cardboard box which is not great, wooden fork and spoon but you still get a plastic cup with your drink? Blankets are wrapped in plastic etc so it is all a bit strange. It feels more another excuse to cut costs rather than anything to do with the environment.The crazy thing with all this is we are paying more than ever for our flights. I recently had a holiday where an all inclusive resort for a family of 5 with massages, food, drink all included was cheaper than the flights!.More Expensive, Worse Service: Despite the fact that the quality of air travel is declining, airlines are still charging more and more for their services while doing everything and anything they can to cut costs. Companies trying to make not just profit but increased profit regardless of the world climate situation.\n    "

    "body": "\n      Travel is the Millennial version of \"keeping up with the Jones\". People like to poke at Boomers for their obsession with lots of toys and possessions, but Millennials / Gen Z have their own obsession with checking off the experience and places been bucket list, and it's every bit as unbalanced.\n    \n\n      1.\u00a0Travel funnels experiences. The classic argument for travel is that it broadens people's experiences in life, but does it really? There's some truly adventurous folks who go far away and really wonder off the beaten path - but by and large, when people go beyond the weekend 2 hr drive range, they stick to \"best of\" lists. Although there's something exotic to far away locations, travelers are really just experiencing all the same sights and experiences as everyone else traveling. National Parks are the prime example.\n    \n\n      We each have our own special \"side of the pond\" on this planet earth with the radius around where we live. Let's explore the uniqueness of our own section of the world instead of swimming over to check out all the already crowded popular spots on other shores.\n    \n\n      2.\u00a0Do we need more experiences? I truly question if anyone these days is actually understimulated? It seems to be the opposite, where people are stressed, anxious, and overcommitted. Millennials have already had way more experiences in their lifetime already than what humans throughout history have had, how many\u00a0more\u00a0experiences does a person need? If people really wanted exposure to different worldviews, they would go talk to the immigrant next door and ask them about their home country and life.\n    \n\n      What it does seem that we need more of is social connection and relationships. But travel gets in the way of building those. 3 days of work minimum for each flight - time to research and book, time in transit, and time to recover / do laundry etc when you're back. That's 3 days you are not out socializing. And we wonder why we have problems retaining freindships?\n    \n\n      3.\u00a0Locals don't really want tourists. Sure the people visiting are enjoying their experiences, but are the locals enjoying your presence? I don't have to post links here, you see it on your news feed with headlines like: \"People in Maui were brought up to resent tourists\", \"Italian official calls tourists 'vandals' after bad behavior\", \"Record traffic and lines getting into Zion\"... True, tourists bring money, but it's simply a chore / job catering to them, unless it's in a location sparsely visited, which sadly is not where most people go.\n    \n\n      Not all exchanges have to have this guest / servant type of behavior. Take art - buying or experiencing a piece of art allows you to inwardly travel to the creativity of another individual, meanwhile sending them $$$ to propel their creative journey forward.\n    \n\n      4.\u00a0It's wasteful. Recent estimate I saw was 8-10% of all emissions result from travel and vacation. That's huge. If Millennials & Gen Z were actually concerned about climate change and resources, they'd think twice before booking the flight.\n    \n\n      Obviously I'm not saying to never get on a plane again, just that we need to tone travel down.\n    \n\n      Edit #1, In no way am I saying do not be adventurous. We should all get outside our bubble and earnestly seek new experiences. The problem is people confuse travel with adventure - you can fly across the world and never get outside the familiar and you can get multitudes of cultural mind opening experiences within our own cities if we seek them out. I can't believe the number of comments assuming I'm some simpleton, you are exactly perpetuating this confusion.\n    \n\n      Edit #2 I'm also not saying don't explore. Yes people should travel some and get international exposure, especially to developing countries. What I'm saying is our culture has gone overboard with the checking the boxes - you don't need to see 23 different countries to be 'well rounded'. And it's a distance thing - exploring our own 3 hour drive radius means we're likely to try out there off the beaten path things, which may be a undiscovered gem or a dud. The attitude that just because you didn't leave your state, that's not 'traveling' is a misguided mindset.\n    "

    "body": "\n      Hi everyone! A while ago I posted asking for tips regarding an upcoming trip I was taking to Europe. I\u2019ve got some chronic health conditions that leave me in pain most of the time and was excited but nervous to be doing such a big trip with that additional stuff to factor in. Anyway, just wanted to give a small update to say that I did it, it was amazing and challenging and the best thing I have ever done! I cannot even believe my luck.\n    \n\n      Before I left I was searching this sub and elsewhere for stories from people like me who had gone away and had some tips to share. I\u2019ll add mine too now for the next person:\n    \n\n      Background / trip itinerary- I live in New Zealand and not near an international airport. From my house to the hotel in London was a 34 hour journey, and on the way back it was 46 hours (got stuck with a two big layovers). Given this, I was pretty exhausted and jet lagged for quite a few days after the flights. I have endo and fibro so I\u2019m tired and in low level pain almost always too.\n    \n\n      I spent a total of 5 weeks away- 3 nights in London 4 nights in Edinburgh 6 more nights in London 4 in Cardiff 6 in Amsterdam 2 in Bruges 5 in Interlaken And 3 nights in Zurich before flying out from there.\n    \n\n      I feel like I spaced everything out well in terms of moving from one place to the next - spending a week each in London and Amsterdam was so worth it because there\u2019s just so much to do! It also let me have chill days without feeling guilty that I was missing out on anything because I still had more time. Getting around was shockingly easy! Never in my life have I experienced public transport so good and I found this everywhere I went to. Taking trains from country to country was such an exciting experience for me coming from an island nation where border crossings are nowhere near as simple lol.\n    \n\n      I took enough of all my medications with me and kept them in a tupperware container in my carry on so they never got lost - I had a note from my dr but nobody ever noticed or asked about them. I also took a mini hot water bottle which was an absolute life saver. Unlike a wheat pack you don\u2019t need a microwave, just access to hot water. This was great for pain days when I needed something soothing for a while.\n    \n\n      I stayed in mix of hotels, hostel private rooms and hostel dorms. The dorms I chose were due to prices elsewhere but I wouldn\u2019t rush to do it again as it was kinda awkward when I was having down time in the afternoons and people were coming in and out asking why I wasn\u2019t enjoying the sun or whatever.\n    \n\n      Someone recommended looking up cafes and parks with seating before I went out for the day - incredible tip! I visited an embarrassing amount of cafes just to have somewhere to sit, particularly in big galleries and museums where there isn\u2019t a lot of seating available.\n    \n\n      I thankfully didn\u2019t have a \u2018flare up\u2019 while overseas but I did get sick with something else unrelated. I thought this would send me into a spiral but I just kept thinking \u201cthere\u2019s nothing you can do right now so just try and be in the moment and enjoy the day. Be practical now and emotional later\u201d and weirdly this helped keep anxiety at bay. I did end up visiting an urgent GP in Switzerland where I had some bloods done and got antibiotics. The process was easy, everyone spoke English and my travel insurance has already paid out.\n    \n\n      Overall, I listened to my body, pushed the limits (but not too much), and had heaps of fun. The \u2018solo\u2019 part had its moments, especially when I just wanted someone else to go bring me food or supplies haha. But was pleasantly surprised at how much my body can do and feel proud that I did it and now have all these great memories. I saw lots of art, the most beautiful architecture, biked around the Netherlands and visited mountain peaks in the Swiss alps. I had down days where I stayed in or close to the hostel but so many more great days. Can\u2019t wait to go again!\n    "

The pain can generally be managed if I\u2019m careful not to sit too long, use a special cushion, do regular stretching, and walk/move my body. But it\u2019s always there, and I bring a cushion with me wherever I go because I can\u2019t sit on any hard surface for more than 15 mins without pain.\n    \n\n      Anyway, I\u2019ve been working more hours at my job lately because I\u2019m leaving for an international trip soon (now in just over a day). That means I\u2019ve been sitting more, which means more pain. On top of that, I just sprained my foot earlier this week (specifically my big toe tendon). This means I now have to minimize weight bearing, cannot go for walks, and cannot do some of the stretches for my sitting pain.\n    \n\n      I\u2019m to the point where I can\u2019t even find a position to sleep without pain. I cannot sleep on my back because my heels hurt against the bed. I can barely sleep on my sides because that is flaring my hip pain. I cannot sleep on my stomach because that would overstretch my injured foot tendon. Sitting hurts, standing hurts, lying hurts, walking hurts.\n    \n\n      I\u2019m stresed (which is also flaring a chronic lip condition I have), in pain (my feet, legs, knees, butt, hips, and now lips), and I am absolutely devastated that all of this will affect my trip so negatively. I seriously don\u2019t even want to go anymore, but I have to. I\u2019m terrified that all of the walking and sitting is going to do more damage to my body. I\u2019m terrified that the hotel bed will not be able to support my body to allow for even a modicum of relief at night. What do i do??\n    \n\n      TL;DR:  Acute injury causing mental anguish and flaring chronic pain. Don\u2019t know what the fuck to do about an international trip I\u2019m starting this week.

    "scraped_at": "2025-11-20 23:43:53",
    "body": "\n      A lot of items and changes that have come into the game over the last few years have been to alleviate \"pain points\", and make certain tedious or slow things simpler or faster. There is a danger, however, of taking this too far and ending up with a much worse problem than you had originally. I can see the community starting to apply pressure in a way that will be detrimental long term, and I think it warrants a discussion.\n    \n\n      There's a famous quote from Civ co-designer Soren Johnson in 2011, which I think deserves to be heeded;\n    \n\n      Given the opportunity, players will optimize the fun out of a game.\n    \n\n      When presented with a challenge in a game, players will always try to streamline that challenge to be as efficient as possible. This will eventually show \"pain points\", the bits in the loop that players find the least interesting.\n    \n\n      When presented with this problem as a developer, you have two variables you can adjust. One is to simplify the bits players don't like, and the other is to redesign them into something more engaging. When it comes to gathering skills, unfortunately the former has been chosen in basically every instance, and it's resulted in what effectively amounts to their death.\n    \n\n      Gathering skills were originally designed as a symbiotic component of production skills, with both existing to provide variety in the resulting gameplay loops. Mining was never meant to be an activity in and of itself to train for the sake of training, it was designed as the first step in the smithing gameplay loop. The intention was a three stage process to create weapons and armour - Mine your ore, smelt your ore into bars, smith your bars into gear. These three steps were designed together as a cohesive loop, each with a different feel to keep one activity from becoming too monotonous. While they're separate skills, they aren't separate in their design.\n    \n\n      The same is obviously true for Mining and Crafting, Mining and Runecrafting, Woodcutting and Firemaking, Woodcutting and Fletching, Woodcutting and Construction, and Fishing and Cooking. Mining, Woodcutting, and Fishing aren't anything by themselves, instead being designed as fundamental common parts to the gameplay loop variety of the skills they support. Since multiple skills need common resources gathered, gathering skills exist as a framework to support those common resources.\n    \n\n      Over the years however, due to their relatively simplistic nature and low interactivity, gathering skills started to feel like a tedious step needed to get to the actual skill. They stopped being viewed as two halves of a whole, and instead just as a roadblock to the main thing.\n    \n\n      The solution seems obvious - All you have to do is provide an easier means of getting the resources needed to train the skill! People seemed to like combat and monsters needed interesting and valuable things to drop, why not add a new way to obtain the resources you need for production skills? It's a win-win, people do less of the content they don't like and monsters have value!\n    \n\n      On the surface this always seems like the obvious fix, encourage the bits players like and simplify the bits they don't. However, this often has deeper ramifications when the nature of player optimisation is taken into account, and it starts a path which results in a far, far bigger issue than there was to begin with.\n    \n\n      To use an example, let's look at Runecrafting. On release the skill had a very clearly designed simple gameplay loop - Mine Rune Essence, take it to an Altar, then use the Altar to craft your runes. This isn't all that different to the loop of smithing fundamentally, with the step of smelting into bars being replaced by a longer run to the Altar, and all items being crafted at once to offset the difference.\n    \n\n      On release this felt incredibly tedious, since the amount of runes produced compared to the amount you use was very low, and the xp rate was incredibly undertuned. With smithing there were two steps that offered xp in both smelting and smithing, but since the only xp for Runecrafting came all at once from clicking on the Altar, it felt like everything was a chore to get to the actual Runecrafting.\n    \n\n      This then fairly quickly ended up with the classic 2004 Law running meta, where players would sit at the Law altar and have noobs and bots exchange an entire inventory of essence for the crafted Law runes. This was great for the people training as it substantially sped up training the skill, but was even more boring as the actual \"work\" of the skill had been optimised away entirely.\n    \n\n      With the speed the higher level players could get through essence, essence then started to become more and more valuable, with mining for profit becoming viable. Since the requirements were so low and the method was so easy and passive, it became a hotbed of activity for noobs and bots alike.\n    \n\n      We now had a situation where noobs were doing the tedious part of the skill without gain to make money and having a terrible time, bots were rampant providing the necessary resources, and skillers had optimised the skilling loop to the point where there was absolutely nothing engaging about training the skill at all. A skill that had been designed around a two phase gathering/crafting loop had been optimised down to standing in a single place, trading, and clicking on a rock, while also creating a huge economy based around an even less interactive clickable rock. Very quickly the skill had been optimised to the point where nobody was having any fun.\n    \n\n      So now you can see the trap - Runecrafting was tedious because the rates were too slow and the rewards weren't good enough for the designed loop. The loop was also incredibly protracted, with few steps and a lot of potential space for optimisation.\n    \n\n      Compared again to Smithing, there was a lot more scope for player optimisation that resulted in the issue compounding itself into a death spiral. Common to both was skipping the Mining and just buying the resources, but that came with a high gold cost and the gold had to be earned somewhere. This kept things somewhat in balance, and in turn made the gathering skills a viable gold earner since the resources had value pressure on them.\n    \n\n      With Smithing, both furnaces and anvils were close enough to banks that it wasn't worth employing a player to do that for you, so the optimal way was to just engage with the skill yourself as intended. With Runecrafting however, since the majority of the balancing of the skill came from the time spent running to distant Altars, there was huge scope for optimising that step. This resulted in the running meta, placed a huge gold sink in front of the skill, and massively disguised the root of the problem - You didn't get enough xp and you didn't get enough runes when engaging with the skill as designed.\n    \n\n      You couldn't increase the xp rates and rune drops from Runecrafting while running was still an option and running was turning the skill into an expensive gold sink for the rich and a tedious borefest for the poor, so instead the approach was taken to simplify away the mining step by dropping the essence passively.\n    \n\n      Back in the early days, in an attempt to alleviate some of the pressure on Rune Essence to combat botting, it was added as a drop to various Slayer monsters when the skill was released. Gargoyles for example had a ~1/20 drop of 35 essence, which meant a trickle would enter the game passively to alleviate the price pressure on essence and hopefully lower botting in the mine. It would also be nice for players wishing to train the skill \"normally\", as now they were getting a bit of passive potential xp without needing to waste time in the mine. This lowered the price pressure somewhat making the skill a bit cheaper to train, but started to fundamentally erode the gathering aspect of the skill.\n    \n\n      Fast forward to OSRS, and players weren't naive enough anymore to run essence for free. Now the value was held in the players time rather than the items generated, and the economy changed to a service economy based around running the essence. This further compounded Runecrafting's reputation as incredibly tedious, and additionally far more expensive than it had been in the past.\n    \n\n      In 2015, Zulrah was added with a common drop of 1,500 essence. At best conventional mining could supply ~2000 an hour, so Zulrah dropped an equivalent of the maximum you could mine passively alongside everything else. For high level players you no longer had to buy or mine your essence, your best bet was just gaining it passively farming Zulrah.\n    \n\n      In 2016, drops from slayer monsters were increased substantially. This included substantially upping the amount of Rune Essence from slayer monsters, including Gargoyles to 150 per drop. You can clearly see on this graph that after that update in the middle of 2016 the price of essence absolutely collapses, and it becomes quite literally worthless.\n    \n\n      In the years since the price of essence has reached an absolute floor of 1gp each, and now it exists in such abundance that obtaining it is functionally irrelevant to the skill. You'll just naturally obtain so much of it that it's barely even worth picking up. Every major boss had essence added to the drop table, slayer chests had them added, supply was now an absolute non-issue.\n    \n\n      As such, Runecrafting has been optimised into entirely the crafting step. This then meant that even for people wanting to train it traditionally, there was nothing to break up the monotony of running back and forth to the altars, and the skill became even more boring than it already was. Sure the relative xp rates were higher since training was now exclusively focused on the crafting, but in trying to optimise a pain point we ended up with a skill that was even less enjoyable to train, and the relevance of Mining as a gathering skill to support other skills further diminished making training Mining feel even more irrelevant.\n    \n\n      Since then, efforts have been made to attempt to course correct and add the mining step back into the skill. The first was the Kourend altars, which required a specific untradable item be mined near to them to force not using Pure Essence. There was also the Daeyalt essance mine, with again untradable essence that this time increased the xp from crafting the runes to try and offset the time spent mining in comparison to just running regular essence. The other big \"fix\" for the skill was Guardians of the Rift, which is incredibly fun but essentially a replacement minigame for the entire skill.\n    \n\n      These all at least understand the core problem with Runecrafting, and by making the essence untradable and requiring it be mined force the player to engage with both the mining and the running aspects of the skill. Daeyalt goes one step further and fixes the issue with xp rates, but ultimately it's fixing it by just superceeding the original rather than actually fixing it.\n    \n\n      I deliberately didn't include it in my list earlier, but in the modern game Farming is fundamentally the symbiotic gathering skill to Herblore. It was added much later than the other gathering skills and as such is a lot more fleshed out, but at its core it's a gathering skill to provide herbs for Herblore.\n    \n\n      Compared to the other gathering skills however, it adds an extra step which makes it much easier to balance - Seeds.\n    \n\n      Seeds are the answer to preventing drops from eliminating gathering skills entirely. Instead of adding herbs directly to boss drop tables, you can instead add the seeds. This gives the player a valuable drop from bosses that helps with their herblore training, but also doesn't entirely skip the gathering skill. It also allows you to substantially speed up the gathering skill itself, by offering much, much higher xp rewards and a much faster collection rate for resources.\n    \n\n      Look at Snapdragons for example, with some notable recent exceptions (which I believe to be a fundamental mistake), barely anything dropped them. However, everything drops snapdragon seeds. This means that fundamentally for the resources to come into the game, the gathering skill needs to be engaged with. This has resulted in a really stable two stage economy, with bosses dropping valuable rewards that help with skilling, and players being able to earn gold by engaging with a gathering skill to produce items. Herb runs are a profitable gathering skill, and it works.\n    \n\n      The issue with Farming, however, is that the skill itself is gated to be disengaging. You teleport to all of your herb patches every few hours, harvest, compost, plant, tele. The actual active time spent training farming is incredibly low, balanced out by high xp rates and the forced waiting.\n    \n\n      This further compounds itself with tree runs, which are objectively the fastest and most efficient way to train the skill and are absolutely, truly, utterly awful. And I say that as someone who actually likes Farming. The best way to train farming is to get absolutely insane xp rates for incredibly short periods every day, and your efficiency isn't the effort you put in or time spent training the skill, but instead how frequently you train the skill.\n    \n\n      Once again however, we come to see how Farming, like other gathering skills, has been streamlined and simplified. The original loop for farming was actually quite involved and engaging, expecting you to rake, compost, frequently water, and then keep an eye on your crops to prevent disease. Then once they're grown, harvest them. You'd then use your crops to create compost, and the better crops you produced the better your compost.\n    \n\n      Over the years, slowly but surely all of those aspects have been optimised away. Auto-weed was added to prevent the need to rake, the bottomless bucket was added to halve the amount of compost you needed and simplify the inventory management, watering was found to be absolutely pointless, tending to the crops was superceeded by both protection, the White Lily, disease-free patches, and just expecting x% to die, and even the needed tools were simplified with barbarian planting.\n    \n\n      Now the skill is faster, but less engaging. You turn up, harvest, note on the Leprechaun, plant, compost, and leave. You don't need to return until you know they're grown, and then you do it all again. With tree runs it's even simpler, paying the gardener to remove the tree instantly, planting, and then paying for protection. The majority of time spent engaging with the skill now is either travelling to a patch or the actual harvesting step, which brings me nicely to the next point.\n    \n\n      One of the new potential rewards from the delve boss is a spade that harvests crops more quickly. Cool! It's a shame it's coming from PvM instead of something farming related, but it's flavourful and improves a \"pain point\" with farming, in that harvesting takes a while.\n    \n\n      I saw some people theorycrafting that mass snape grass with instant gathering could actually be faster effective xp/hr than tree runs are at present, which on the surface sounds great to me. Allotments should be a viable way to train the skill! There should be a more active method than tree runs that rewards higher effective xp, and (dailyscape issues aside) tree runs should be a slower, more passive method that you do in the background like Birdhouses are to Hunter.\n    \n\n      Actively running around to all of the allotments, planting something and harvesting when you get to the end of the loop should be a better way to actively train than engaging for 30 seconds every day, but as things are, trees are both the lowest engagement and the highest xp. So that's definitely the way to improve farming - Buff snape grass so that it's a viable, higher effort alternative to tree runs! And the spade making it faster is a great way to do that!\n    \n\n      ...yes?\n    \n\n      The reason I'm actually writing this post is after seeing discussion on the new spade, and a large pro-spade backlash to the backlash. While it seems like a really nice little reward \"It speeds up a boring thing you're doing!\", to me under the surface it's actually yet another concerning slide towards optimising away engagement. Since the majority of time spent farming is actually now the harvesting step, speeding that up even by half will remove yet more engagement out of the skill.\n    \n\n      If the spade was added in its original form, what even is farming? You turn up to a patch, click to harvest, click twice to compost, click twice to plant, and leave all within about 6 seconds. Suddenly the bulk of time spent on the skill is no longer engaging with farming, it's basically just pulling everything out of your bank and running to the plots. Because tree runs are the benchmark for efficiency right now and they're both incredibly high xp and incredibly low engagement, they feel like the ideal to be aimed for. This, however, is another symptom of the optimisation mindset that is slowly but surely sapping away any gathering engagement from skills, resulting in them feeling worse rather than better. What farming actually needs is more interactivity, not less. If you're going to add a reward to improve it, it should be more steps, not fewer.\n    \n\n      Say for example if the spade could be used on the plot after harvesting to turn over the soil, improving yield on your next trip. It improves xp rates and items per seed so and is an objective buff, but it makes the skill more engaging and actually increases the time you spend interacting. It adds an extra action to your planting and it adds additional actions to your harvesting, for the benefit of more resources and more xp. That's why compost exists, you trade off additional actions for additional reward.\n    \n\n      Incentivising active farming would be a huge benefit to the skill, and would go a long way to making it feel like less of a tedious chore. Tree runs should be disincentivised not only because they're too powerful in terms of efficient xp, but also because they're inherently unengaging and promote an incredibly negative playstyle and interaction with the skill. They don't need to be removed entirely, but as I mentioned earlier, like birdhouses they should only be a passive bonus to active training rather than a wholesale replacement.\n    \n\n      Looking at \"It speeds up a boring thing you're doing\" again, this gets right to the heart of what I've been outlining. By speeding up the boring thing instead of adding variety to make the boring thing a smaller facet of the whole, you end up optimising to a point where things feel even worse in the long run. The more you streamline, the less you have to do, and the worse things get.\n    \n\n      I'm sorry about how wordy this is, but I've been thinking about this for a long time. We're getting to a point where the cracks are really starting to show, and I think a big change in direction is needed to prevent the beast from growing to an unmanagable size.\n    \n\n      I think there needs to be a substantial look at all of the core gathering skills, and I think they need to be reintegrated into skill training loops as a symbiotic and engaging part, not a separate chore. Doing that makes both the gathering skill feel less pointless, and adds variation and variety into the loop for the production skill.\n    \n\n      The root cause of the issues for a lot of them in the modern game is direct resource drops from bosses, as they cause a negative feedback loop disincentivising gathering and causing production to be far less varied. I personally think the solution is for bosses to drop something that creates high efficiency resource gathering, such as herb seeds for Farming and Herblore, and for production skills to rely more on their gathering loops again.\n    \n\n      Hopefully what I've described makes sense, because at the end of the day I want to play the game. The more things are sped up, streamlined, and automated, the less of the game there actually is to play. Buffs shouldn't incentivise engaging less, they should give you additional benefit for engaging more.\n    "

Every year she wants to visit home, we used to fly but since we have a kid (2f) she now wants to drive.\n    \n\n      I have no problem using all my vacation days for this, she lives here. Traveling is a pain because she overpacks. Used to fill my CX-7 FULL,  but work gave me a $900 car allowance and we used that to get a full size Surburban. This time she loaded THAT full. I mean front passenger to the ceiling so I can't see the mirrors full.\n    \n\n      We didn't use hardly any of it. Every stop I carried everything into the hotel because she was afraid it would get stolen. It's 3 days each way\n    \n\n      Got through it, told her she makes traveling miserable because she is also super late. Tell her 10am. She might arrive by noon. So Every day we don't leave the hotel until 12, then she insists we drive until midnight, ugh, unfun\n    \n\n      Anyway. This weekend I was sent on a work conference. They got me a sweet hotel room, week at a nice resort, super excited.\n    \n\n      We were going to go and leave the baby. Day before she cancels my mom watching to bring our child. Fills the suburban full, again. Mind you, it's my work trip. 5 days, 5 nights\n    \n\n      Most of the stuff was just over packing. She brought a tote of blankets. One of towels. Two of her clothes! Totes!!\n    \n\n      I told her she makes it miserable (the hotel always gets cluttered and full, the night before we leave is always a mess trying to pack and her \"organizing\" stuff she brought that never gets used.\n    \n\n      She freaked out, told me i just want to go hook up and cheat at these things (I invited here) and she is filing for a divorce because I told her \"your overpacking and insisting we fill every vehicle full and always being late makes me.miserable\".. we were 3 hours late leaving to get to the conference, so I missed the networking opening night which is where in my industry people tend to clic up afterwards to a degree. I missed going to the best vendor events, etc, because she insisted that I don't leave because she was overwhelmed with how messy the hotel room was. (Mind you, it was all the stuff she brought, took out of totes, and never used, and the toddler then destroyed.\n    \n\n      AITAH?\n    \n\n      Edits\n    \n\n      Yes I am involved in raising our child. I actually packed for our trip, I had one bag for baby to go to mom's (toys, diapers, food, etc). A big bag but one large suitcase. I had a bag packed for wife and one for me.\n    \n\n      Yes, she had ADHD\n    \n\n      She always says she doesn't want to do this, then trip comes and she does it.\n    \n\n      I am not a cheater.

Are there any products (pain relievers, knee braces, compression gear) you find particularly helpful that you would recommend?\n    \n\n      If it helps, I\u2019m a woman in my early to mid 20s. Thanks in advance!\n    \n\n      EDIT - to avoid common suggestions: I selected my seat upon booking and there were no aisle seats available whatsoever. I am also traveling with a friend on a tight budget, and given the price of upgrades on trans-Pacific flights, that\u2019s not really an option. Assume I\u2019m stuck with the middle economy seat. This has also been an issue for me for some time so I know that getting up and moving is good. I\u2019m more looking for specific products or exercises that are helpful.\n    "

I've been here before but not them so she thought it'd Also be nice for me to guide them around for a bit. My cousin is the pickiest eater I have ever had the displeasure of travelling with. Such a royal pain in the butt. For her, even jokbal (pork trotters) is too \"exotic and weird\". We passed by a dakgalbi restaurant and she also refused because she's worried it'll be spicy (it's literally not...). We had a delicious kbbq dinner but she only ate plain meat and rice because she refused to eat any of the free side dishes. She sulked the whole dinner and we had to go to Subway after that. What about Korean fried chicken? Who doesn't like that?? HER. The most irritating and audacious thing happened today. We went to a Korean Chinese restaurant and I ordered my favourite jajangmyeon, my aunt ordered jjampong and cousin ordered... dumplings. Yay. Something she's willing to eat. When my jajangmyeon came, she looked at it with disgust and let out a silent \"Eww\". And at some point even said something along the lines of \"that looks disgusting\" \"you really like that?\" ...I was really annoyed and pissed at that point but I didn't want to get angry on vacation so I just said \"Yeah it actually tastes better than it looks, want some?\" She shook her head and didn't say anything else. I just found her comments so stupid and uncalled for because I spent some time on the map app searching for restaurants that has food her stupid palate can handle. Anyways we're fortunately parting ways tomorrow as I am moving to Suwon and then Busan so I can't wait to enjoy the rest of my trip eating all my favourite Korean food and she can eat all the sandwiches she want. I don't care if I sound childish or petty because I just needed to let this out because I've been so sick of her.\n    \n\n      Korea is amazing though I highly recommend.\n    "

Here\u2019s my new signature combination; hoping it can help!\n    \n\n      Afrin Severe Congestion Nasal Spray: I used this about an hour before descent began, but it worked to clear my sinuses pretty much instantly.\n    \n\n      OTC Sudafed w/ pseudoephedrine: The dose is two tablets; I took one tablet about two hours before descent & the other tablet about an hour before.\n    \n\n      Earplanes plugs: Found these in a shop at the airport - they can be found at pretty much any pharmacy or on Amazon, too. I put them in when descent began, or about 30 minutes before the arrival time. I took them out once the cabin doors opened.\n    \n\n      Over-ear, noise cancelling headphones: I personally used Beats, but I\u2019m sure any other brand would work just as well. These primarily just held the Earplanes in place, but I\u2019ve heard that the noise cancellation can help as well. I used them throughout the flight, but would put them on overtop of the Earplanes during descent.\n    \n\n      Gum: I started chewing when descent began, about 30 minutes before arrival time. Make sure to swallow frequently, & switch the side you\u2019re chewing on occasionally.\n    \n\n      This may seem like a lot, but it\u2019s so worth it to me! Severe pain & ear blockage has always been an issue for me when flying, so much so that I almost gave up flying & traveling for good because of it. I\u2019d be sobbing during landing, & couldn\u2019t hear properly for days afterwards. I tested out a ton of different methods & combinations on my past few flights, & this was the winning combo! I had very minimal pain on descent, & my ears cleared within 30 minutes of landing. Hopefully this can help you too!\n    \n\n      Edit: As lots of comments have stated, an ENT will be your #1 solution if you\u2019re experiencing pain like I\u2019ve described. In my case, I was unable to secure an appointment until /after/ my trip, & so needed a solution much sooner. If you\u2019re in a similar situation & /need/ to fly for whatever reason, this combination of things worked very well for me. I\u2019ll be seeing the ENT regardless, though!\n    "

I did not overload my day with too many things, but walking a lot is inevitable.\n    \n\n      Shoes: The trip was planned just 4 weeks before I actually went. So not a lot of time to plan everything. With shoes, I went to the store and tried a lot of different shoes from Nike, New Balance, and Asics. A lot of impressive stuff. I was set on Nike Invincible Run 3. The cushion was amazing and unlike anything I'd seen. But it had heavy heel slippage. I decided to way for Run 4. Instead, I got the Ultraboost 22 on sale. Been using ultraboost for about 7 years now and it was a safe choice.\n    \n\n      Preparing: I am a fairly healthy person. I hit the gym 3-4 times a week, but focus more on strength training. And my cardio fitness is definitely poor. So for 2 weeks before the trip, I walked for 2 hours straight. Clocking in 10km on the threadmill. I am not sure if it helped. But it definitely did help in breaking in my new shoes.\n    \n\n      Trip Stats: As I said, significant walking is inevitable. According to my Apple Watch, I'd walked for 110km, or 150,000 steps in the 8 days. An average of 13.75km per day. It does not account for the difficulty in standing in lines, train, stations, etc.\n    \n\n      Pain: Even with all this preparation I had significant pain in all parts of my leg every day. Usually started post 6-7pm but it was manageable. It has to do with a couple of things: Lots of standing, and not being able to walk at a steady pace.\n    \n\n      What I realised is, walking for 2 hours straight even at a fast and steady pace is easy. However, mixing up the pace is hard. When you're walking on the road or footpaths, there are  other people around you. You cannot walk at same speeds. This definitely contributed  towards a lot of pain for me.\n    \n\n      Salt Baths: Every day when I got back to the hotel I took a 20 minute soak in hot water with epsom salt. Again not sure if it helps, but it was relaxing.Kinesiology Tape: This was amazing! A good quality Kinesiology tape can be a bit expensive. Also, you need some practice to use it. A month before the trip, I got some tape and practice different taping for potential pain points that I've experienced in my leg in the past. During the trip, the heel was my biggest pain point towards the end of the day due to long hours of standing. Kinesiology tape was amazing. I taped my heels every day from day 3 and experienced less pain and better balance throughout the trip.If you intend to use it, you need to learn different types of taping before the trip. And during the trip, try to observe what your pain points are, and tape your leg focusing on those points for the next day.Theragun Mini: Another handy tool. I used it to massage my feet and back every day after my bath to recover. Again not sure if it really helps, but it was nice and relaxing.\n    "

Friend 1 was so cheap and only wanted to do free sightseeing as well as eat from Subway or McDonald's. By the way, he makes more than all of us.  Friend 2 has a small bank so her card didn't work the whole time and I ended up paying for all her stuff. She paid me back, but I just felt bad for charging her for little stuf I paid for (e.g. appetizers, or a few dollars items, as well as short uber rides). I grew up from a giving community, so I didn't mind it. However, after all my calculations, I sort of regret it. She also woke up so late - around 1 or 2pm. For the first few days, I was so frustrated that we had to wait for her since she is the main social butterfly. I got so angry, so I just leave in the morning by myself. Leaving everyone early brought a tension, and they all thought I was being neglectful. Friend 3 (who I am not close to but is the friend of 2) didn't even have money. He only paid for the flight and lodge, but he didn't have money for anything else. I felt bad and helped pay for most of his stuff because I didn't want him to be stuck in the AirBnB we all share. Of course, it added up and I lost so much money.

    "body": "\n      *This is all my personal opinion, not that of Bilt or any other partner we have* All the major banks and many other companies have travel portals to allow their members to redeem currency and allow the bank to earn a share of travel commissions. We all know and are familiar with the portals of Chase, Citi, American Express, and Capital One\u2014 but also many tourism operators, smaller banks and credit unions, large companies for employee travel and B2B platforms host similar travel portals.\u00a0\n    \n\n      Why use a portal to provide travel to members? The aggregation of airline, hotel, car rental and activity (tour) inventory and pricing at scale is incredibly difficult and these days near impossible. Airline and hotel distribution is incredibly disjointed across a swath of inventory sources operating on what I\u2019d generously call 1993 technology. On the airline side, you have the NDC (new distribution capability - worth some research if you aren\u2019t familiar) and the old GDS and on the hotel side there is an even wider array of hotel and lodging inventory sources that really boggle the mind when you see the scale. Google \u2018bed banks\u2019 if you want to go down a rabbit hole.\u00a0\n    \n\n      This is why the vast majority of these portals are run by Expedia (and its many subsidiaries) or Booking Holdings (and its many subsidiaries). They have the inventory and pricing for someone like Bilt to instantly plug into and offer members the ability to book worldwide travel and earn and redeem loyalty currency. The vast majority of these portals (Including Bilt\u2019s) operate on what we call white label template (WLT) products where the portal you see is a customized skin of Expedia or Booking\u2019s website. We use Expedia at Bilt. Besides WLT, you could also choose an Expedia or Booking API business and plug the inventory directly into a custom built front end experience. This is a much more labor intensive but also much more flexible business where you can display what you want, where you want and how you want (subject to a few rules of the API business).\u00a0\n    \n\n      The portals are good in the fact that shortly after launch we had a robust travel marketplace available for members to redeem Bilt Points at 1.25 cents each, and let me tell you, we have thousands of members who do this seamlessly every month. I see performance in real time and you guys and gals love redeeming your points at 1.25 cents each for flights and hotels, and thats great for you. On the commercial side, the travel portal servicer and the company using it will negotiate a split of the commissions. Travel commissions are\u2026.not simple. Talk to any travel agent you know and they spend way way too much of their day chasing commissions. Luckily Expedia handles this for us and cut us a check every month, another huge positive. There are other factors to consider like cost of servicing, cost of payment acceptance, different payment avenues (when all Bilt Points or some Bilt points are used) and more. Its not a simple operation.\n    \n\n      Many of us are also familiar with the downside of the portals that are espoused everyday here on Reddit, on (the few remaining) points and miles blogs and now everyday on social media:\n    \n\n      There are regular price disparities between what you might see publicly available for flights and hotels. Bilt does not have any say on the pricing or inventory you see for hotels and flights, this is entirely controlled by Expedia and their contracts with the different travel providers. (A rather complicated relationship due to what I personally see as a misalignment of incentives where OTAs are constantly trying to gain commission and the travel provider wants to save commission but now requires the distribution).\u00a0\n    \n\n      Customer service can be difficult with travel providers not willing to take on customer service for non-direct bookings and Expedia and Booking have to try and solve for global customer support at a massive scale. I know we all see the complaints but you never see the thousands of customers who book with no issues. We look at the Expedia NPS score every month and it has almost always been in the excellent range from Expedia\u2019s chat and call center metrics.\u00a0\n    \n\n      Lack of activation and customization - there are so many cool things you could do if you had the ability to customize rates, fares, sales, deals, credits, earn and burn accelerators\u2026I have an endless list. However, you need to work in tandem with your WLT product provider and that often has very long lead times and large institutions don\u2019t move as fast as we can.\u00a0\n    \n\n      These aren\u2019t direct bookings and you won\u2019t earn points or elite status progress on the hotel side. There is a lot of argument about the treatment of guests who come from an OTA vs. a direct booking. I\u2019ve seen and read a lot of anecdotal evidence but I\u2019ve never seen or heard a hotel or airline say they purposely treat these guests worse, but I think there is likely an element to this.\u00a0\n    \n\n      I\u2019ll conclude by saying that there is an insane, albeit incredibly difficult, opportunity for a program that figures out how to solve the challenges of a travel portal while maintaining the scale of business. Travel is inherently difficult from your side, the Bilt member, due to research and logistics required to plan that perfect trip. On our side, executing the business of providing worldwide travel at scale is equally as difficult to do well.\u00a0I'm excited for 2025.\n    \n\n      Hope this was helpful, as always shoot any questions below. See ya out there - Kerr, Bilt\u00a0\n    "

    "body": "\n      Hello everyone, Monday a really weird thing happened to me while the plane was landing:\n    \n\n      suddenly I experienced a very strong pain on my left eyebrow, like if a vein popped, and then it started expanding resulting me having terrible stabbing/electric pain all over my left eye, upper nose and forehead. If I touched where it hurt I could feel a sort of electric pain all over that region.\n    \n\n      My ears was completely fine, though, since my nose felt free and didn\u2019t have a cold.\n    \n\n      It calmed down when the plane was completely landed, but it bothered me up to 24 hours post flight.\n    \n\n      I only flied when I was six (and has just ear pain) and now, but the round trip didn\u2019t give me pain at all.\n    \n\n      I have to fly again on May and I can\u2019t schedule a medical appointment before the next flight.\n    \n\n      Has it ever happened to any of you?

    "scraped_at": "2025-11-20 23:46:07",
    "body": "\n      This is a collection of my top strategies to save money, fly smart and meet people, while also being practical and relatively easy. Most of these apply for long haul international flights where I as an Australian living in Melbourne am quite far from a lot of countries.\n    \n\n      I would love some feedback, new ideas and if you tried any and how it went :)\n    \n\n      Fly between the largest possible hub airports, more airlines competing == lower fares. Taking a train 3-6 hour once you arrive for $20 is better than a more \u2018convenient\u2019 flight for $200 more. This site shows what connected airports are biggest: https://www.flightconnections.com/\n    \n\n      Let flight deals dictate your travel plans, flights are often the most expensive aspect. You  could save over $1k if you travel based on deals instead of wanting to go to specific place at a specific time\n    \n\n      Look at flights way ahead of time but when you\u2019re planning to book, as you do, flights get \u2018hotter\u2019, try and wait a day after you concluded your search so prices \u2018cool down\u2019\n    \n\n      Use a cheap old android phone in incognito mode to search flights and prices. Searching on a high end MacBook sometimes gets you higher fares, especially when booking directly with airlines\n    \n\n      Statistically the cheapest time to book is 64 days before desired departure\n    \n\n      Don't bring a checked bag for ultimate savings and airport convenience. Also, no lost bag\n    \n\n      Churn a credit card to save $500+ on a flight with travel points. Many credit cards offer a 1 year sign up for free, bonus signup points and include travel insurance\n    \n\n      If flying 10+ hours, deliberately choose a flight with the longest layover possible, bonus if you'd arrive in the stopover country late in the afternoon. You'll be able to get a much better sleep in a hotel in the stopover country, in addition to saving bucket loads on the flight. You can also leverage stopover to \u2019tick off\u2019 other countries/places you'd otherwise not visit\n    \n\n      Some excellent dates to fly out is on Christmas or New year's days early in the morning. Bonus, try to fly to countries that don't celebrate the same holidays as yours so you get a holiday aligned with your work break but you don't pay through the nose on the place you're going. E.g do easter in China, or Australia Day in New Zealand\n    \n\n      Try to travel when your local state has public holidays, this reduces the leave you need to take. My favourite time is between Easter and Australian Anzac Day because a lot of countries don't have days off for then so they often aren't more expensive AND it's not school holidays, but you also get 3 free days of leave\n    \n\n      December is always expensive to fly. Try to either depart on one of the last days of November or return on one of the first days of January\n    \n\n      If you get all the way through the flight booking process and it tells you prices have increased so \u201cgo back and start again\u201d. Give it at least 24 hours before retrying. Sometimes even a week if you can be patient, let prices \u2018cool down\u2019\n    \n\n      A lot of marketplaces have people selling flight vouchers and credits, often if you're planning to book at the same time you find a seller and you tell them you'll book immediately they'll discount you more (upto and beyond 30%) where you can also validate the credit works along side them.\n    \n\n      Always check the weather for the month in the place you're planning to book. E.g A tropical island in monsoon season is often worse than not going at all. My biggest tip is travel to places when they're experiencing their best weather\n    \n\n      Find good flights on third party sites, note the dates and airline, wait a day then use the airlines site directly. It's often a few dozen dollars cheaper\n    \n\n      If you're searching for flights on the month \u201cview\u201d, often when you click a departure date you'll see a lot return dates that aren't populated eg ?With only a few good ones, this is to incentivise you to book a specific period that's best for the airline. To take advantage, pick some departure dates close to when you'd like to return and notice the best return flights that actually load. Now pick a better earlier departure date, if the return day you want has changed to a ?If you click it anyway and search, you'll find it's the same price.\n    \n\n      If travelling with one other person and you feel like getting a row to yourselves. Book the window and the aisle, the single \u2018\u2019between\u201d seats are last to get filled. If someone does take it, it's usually easy to swap them for the window or aisle, if not then one of you gets the floor and the other gets the row of seats, have a nice sleep!\n    \n\n      If you want to visit multiple countries in one big trip, book a return from home to country A, then another return from country A to country B ($). This will save about 30% rather than doing home > A > B > home ($$$). Also you'll get to \u201ctaste test\u201d country A. Better still, book home > country A city A, then travel to country A city B and do a return to country B ($$)\n    \n\n      The far right seat at the back center of the plane where it decreases from 4 to 3 has the most space and doesn't cost much extra. You can put your leg way out and it wont get bumped by passers by or the trolley\n    \n\n      Ensure you're the last on the flight and then go into the bathroom, wait until they tell you to get out and pick whatever seat you want on the plane - everyone should be seated by then\n    \n\n      Wear a pride wrist band on each sleeve to potentially get both arm rests on the flight, works when seated next to men\n    \n\n      Laptops are heavy, when checking in, put it inside the back of your pants under your shirt. Once your bags have been weighed, put it back in your bag. This also works if they weigh at the boarding gate\n    \n\n      Bring an empty water bottle, most airports have filling fountains\n    \n\n      Wear your heaviest clothes on you on the plane, you aren\u2019t weighed\n    \n\n      Airport Chappell's are the quietest place to be, good for a sleep\n    \n\n      Never exchange cash at an airport FX converter. The best place is a bank, second best is an ATM. With ATMs, always decline it to do the fx conversion, your bank will do it for you at a better rate automatically\n    \n\n      If you want to bring a second carry on bag, bring one that's a modest size. At the duty free area, buy the cheapest thing you can like a pack of tim tams and then ask for a duty free bag. Put your second carry on inside it. Most airlines allow a bonus duty free bag in addition to one carry on\n    \n\n      Put a napkin between your phone and your phone case sticking out on one side, put that side in the tray table locking mechanism with the tray up for a simple phone holder\n    \n\n      Alternatively, Use a selfie stick to hold your phone for movies on a flight in a much higher and more ergonomic position, allowing you to better lean back, saving your neck\n    \n\n      Don't watch shows with short episodes or play games with short arcady levels. You'll check the clock everytime you finish one and it'll make time drag on. Watch long movies, play endless games or my favorite: be productive on something that gets you \u2018\u2019in the zone\u201d like coding, reading or writing\n    \n\n      Get a hotel with an included buffet, eat like crazy and take as much food away as possible. Also, do this as late into the breakfast period as you can to feel full for as much of the day as you can - don't do this at little hotels, only chains for ethical reasons\n    \n\n      Random hotel lobbies have the cleanest bathrooms - Just act like you booked a room\n    \n\n      Get an inflatable ergonomic pillow, you'll never have neck pain from bad hotel/hostels pillows. Tip: Only inflate it about half way for best softness\n    \n\n      Don't get a universal charger. If you don't travel a lot you'll lose it or lose an important piece of it. I think it's best to get a singular adapter designed for the destination countries plug for each trip and just keep a collection. They are simpler, lighter and often more reliable\n    \n\n      If you have to cancel a hotel reservation but it's not free anymore, ask to rebook it later. Then cancel\n    \n\n      Confirm stay and arrivals times with hotels a few days beforehand, it prevents your room being overbooked and you being stranded. Further, be really nice and ask if you could get a free upgrade\n    \n\n      Bring two phones. I like to film/take photos with my nicer phone but doing so drains the battery a lot, this leads me to bring a battery bank and cables which is a pain. A second (usually old or cheap) phone can be what you use for maps, texting, travel sim and itinerary so you'll often end the day with both phones on 50% charge. Bonus tip, bring a tiny 10cm USB C-C cable and both phones can charge each other so you don't need a battery bank at all\n    \n\n      Get a passport travel wallet that opens with the fold on the shorter side so you can fit notes and boarding passes without needing to fold them up awkwardly\n    \n\n      Instead of a thick raincoat, bring a \u2018\u2019single use\u2019 poncho. You can totally use these dozens of times on a single trip\n    \n\n      If you wear sandals, you don't need to pack any socks\n    \n\n      Merrino wool shirts only need to be washed every 4 days max if you're heavily sweating, less if you\u2019re not. They also dry super fast after a rinse in the sink with soapy water. You could easily do a 2 week trip with 3 shirts and only washing one once\n    \n\n      Add mini carabiners to any loops on the outside of your bag, then you can attach anything that itself has a loop so you don't need to carry it\n    \n\n      Get a foldable water bottle, as it empties it takes up less space. Get a good one otherwise the water will taste awful\n    \n\n      Get a 65w + GaN charger - They\u2019re tiny but a little expensive\n    \n\n      Bring a lightweight thin bag with drawer strings for dirty washing. Keep it seperate from your clean clothes, it\u2019ll take almost no space when empty and they\u2019re less noisy than plastic bags which hostels bunmates will be thankful for\n    \n\n      NoDoz is a capsule caffeine tablet that gives great energy and will dramatically improve your mood when you're tired\n    \n\n      Ear buds take up a lot less space than headphones on a flight and the noise cancelling is usually \u2018good enough\u2019\n    \n\n      Work remotely 3 days a week while travelling if you\u2019re allowed. You'll appreciate those 3 \u201crest days\u201d and become more attuned to the area you\u2019re staying while also planning your busier days closer to when you'll actually do them. You also retain 3/5ths of an income and only use up 2/5th of your annual leave\n    \n\n      If staying in a hostel, cook for everyone! It's fun to get some randoms together to go ingredient shopping, especially if none of you know the language, it becomes a real mission. Then while cooking people will be stoked to socialise with you, they'll be grateful and often return the favour\n    \n\n      Taking photos or videos on a phone that automatically backs up with google photos or iCloud is way better than needing to offload an SD card and manually do it yourself every day off of a camera. Also your phone adds metadata that makes searching for moments easier. Bonus, you can make albums for specific people and after a trip, send it to them so they have all their photos of themselves from you in one place\n    \n\n      If you're planning to take a ride share app to/from the airport. Check it regularly before you actually need to go and track the prices. Likely you'll see it double and halve as demand grows and shrinks. Work out what \u201ccheap\u201d is and once you see it, tap \u201cschedule in advance\u201d for a time you\u2019ll be ready to go\n    \n\n      Keep a digital copy of all your documents, tickets, passport, visas, hotels on your phone in a locally saved folder\n    \n\n      Always have an airtag in each bag you're travelling with\n    \n\n      Download maps of the areas you'll travel in advance. So that even if you don't have a Sim you still get GPS, also sometimes the downloaded map will have a detailed floorpan of the airport\n    \n\n      Download the local language on google translate in advance too\n    \n\n      Hydralyte tablets and gastro stop will make short work of any food poisoning\n    \n\n      Bring some basic colored string to braid friendahip bracelets for people you meet\n    \n\n      If travelling in less developed countries, the biggest source of illness is bad water. Don't consume ice, sliced fruit or meat. Opt for vegan food in hot boiling wateror steamed and or go for reputable chains to avoid getting sick. Sneaky tip, eat places where you see kids and crows lined up, parents usually put a lot of work into ensuring their kids won't get sick so they\u2019ve done the work for you.\n    \n\n      \n    \n\n      Hope this helps some of you!If anyone is in Vietnam, Cambodia or Laos in March this year, please reach out! I love meeting people\n    \n\n      \n    \n\n      \n    \n\n      Edit: Lot's of very fair criticism for a few of these, naturally with such a long list that has been curated over years, some may seem obvious, others may seems offensive.\n    \n\n      To address them:\n    \n\n      - Do not hold up the plane waiting in the bathroom, I still recomend trying to be one of the last one's to board though, if only to spend less time cramped on the plane. This is less ideal if you need an overhead baggage stowed but if you only have one bag then you should be fine and if the plane is kinda empty, you could still get a better seat, just make sure it's free, ideally wait until takeoff like most people do\n    \n\n      - Booking with an old phone probably won't get you cheaper flights. To me it always *felt* like it did, but it's unlikely\n    \n\n      - Don't wear pride bracelets if you don't support the movement or soley to make others uncomfortable. I'm ace and a strong supporter, when wearing them while flying out of Thailand I discovered this 'hack' that got some rude old gentlemen to throw a fit. Regardless, showing pride is also a great conversation starter and a nice way to make friends, so I still recommend it\n    \n\n      - Weather! Yes it seems obvious to travel in 'good weather' but when you discover an outstanding deal it may slip your mind and you don't realise it's monsoon or heatwave season, so always good to check. Others recommend travelling on the 'shoulder' season if you can, which I highly recommend\n    \n\n      Overall I'm really glad you guys like the adhoc list I've built over time, it's something I'll keep building as I travel. Thanks for all the support!\n    \n\n      \n    "
